Overview
This repository contains Python code for a multiple linear regression exercise using a real estate dataset. The goal is to predict real estate prices based on property size and the year of acquisition. Real estate serves as a classic example commonly employed in regression courses due to its simplicity and the often-present causal relationships.

Instructions
Load the Data:
Read the real estate dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The file name is 'real_estate_price_size_year.csv'.

Standardize the Data:
Utilize standardization to scale the independent variables ('size' and 'year').

Create Multiple Linear Regression Model:
Implement a multiple linear regression model using the standardized data.

Display Intercept and Coefficients:
Retrieve and display the intercept and coefficients of the regression model.

Calculate R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:
Find and compare the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values.

Compare with Simple Linear Regression:
Compare the R-squared values between this multiple linear regression and the simple linear regression where only 'size' was used.

Make a Prediction:
Use the model to make a prediction for an apartment with a size of 750 sq.ft. from the year 2009.

Find Variable P-values:
Calculate the univariate (or multivariate) p-values for the two independent variables ('size' and 'year'). Analyze the significance of these p-values.

Create Summary Table:
Summarize your findings in a table for clear presentation.
